        Stir in the spices and sugar and cook for another minute, then add the stock and soy sauce, bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. 
        Tip everything into a blender and blitz until smooth.</li>
    <li>Wipe out the pan and fry the chicken in the remaining oil until it is browned all over. 
        Tip the sauce back into the pan and bring everything to a simmer, stir in the peas and cook for 5 minutes. 
        Add a little water if you need to thin the sauce. Serve with rice.</li>
